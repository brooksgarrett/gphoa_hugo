Dear Community Members,
 
The AT&T U-verse fiber upgrade is projected to begin in your neighborhood later next year. About a week before the job 
starts, AT&T crews will enter the neighborhood and place door hangers to alert the residents that the project will be 
starting soon.
 
Attached is an information letter from AT&T and a Frequently Asked Questions sheet.  If you have any other questions, 
please contact us at [engper@anscollc.com](mailto:engper@anscollc.com). We look forward to hearing from you.
