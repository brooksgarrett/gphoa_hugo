This deadline (Wednesday, June 17th) is for residents that ALREADY reside in Grove Pointe. If you already live here and you want a pool membership for 2015, you must join by this date.

Likewise, IF YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID, but haven't picked up your fob or signed your waiver, this is also the last day to do that. We've had 4 pick-up/sign-up times since the pool opened, all at varying times to accommodate everyone's schedules.
After this date, we will only allow new residents (owner and tenants) to purchase a pool membership...those that move in AFTER 6/17/15.
If you don't get a membership this year, you will have to wait until next year to join the pool.

We hope this answers your questions!
