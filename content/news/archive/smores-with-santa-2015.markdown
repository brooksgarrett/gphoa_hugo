Mark your calendars for S'mores with Santa!

*Friday, December 4th from 6-8:30*

Santa Claus will be joining us to collect all the children's letters and take pictures while we roast marshmallows and make s'mores with the family! We will kick off the Christmas season with hot chocolate and a holiday movie under the stars! Don't forget your letters to Santa and lawn chairs for the movie!
